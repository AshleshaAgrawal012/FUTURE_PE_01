# FUTURE_PE_Task-1
This project demonstrates how I used AI tools to generate YouTube scripts, thumbnails, and videos using prompt engineering.


ðŸ§  Project Summary
This project showcases how I created two complete videos using various AI tools and prompt engineering techniques. I began by using Gemini Pro 2.5 for short video generation (limited to 8 seconds per output), which I later edited and compiled using Canva. For scripting and prompt refinement, I experimented with ChatGPT and Grok AI to generate creative inputs for video, voice, and imagery. I converted the final script into a realistic voiceover using 11Labs. Additionally, I explored VeedAI, which directly produced a video with integrated voice, though with more limited visuals. All documentation was prepared using Notion AI, which made organizing and presenting the workflow seamless and intuitive. This end-to-end process helped me explore, compare, and creatively use AI tools to produce high-quality content efficiently.
